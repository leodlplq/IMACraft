# IMACraft

This is our 2nd year OpenGL project at IMAC <img src="https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/images/logoIMAC.png" height="15px">. The aim of this project is to make a clone of the famous game Temple Run. 
We have decided to play this game in the world of Minecraft so you will be able to embodies our favourite character : Steve.
